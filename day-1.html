  <h1>Templates</h1>

  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">Read more about
      templates here.</a>
  </p>

  <p>We know about variables. We know about Strings. We will now learn about But how to we put them together?</p>
  <p> We use backticks and ${ }. Have a look at an example</p>

  <h2>Example 1</h2>
  <p>Lets look at some variables and write them out in a string.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let playerName;
      playerName = "John";
      document.write(`Hi, ${playerName}. Welcome to the game!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let dinnerItem;
      dinnerItem = "Lasagna";
      document.write(`We are having ${dinnerItem}, tonight!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let fruit;
      fruit = "strawberry";
      document.write(`It's ${fruit} season.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Example 2</h2>
  <p>You can have as many variables as you want. You can even use numbers!</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let a;
      let b;
      let c;

      a = 12;
      b = 3;
      c = a + b;
      document.write(`${a} plus ${b} is equal to ${c}.`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      c = a * b;
      document.write(`${a} times ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      a = 512;
      b = 64;
      c = a / b;
      document.write(`${a} divided by ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Try it!</h2>
  <p>Now you try it!</p>
  <p>Make at least 5 more examples of templates yourself.</p>
  <h2>Example 3</h2>
  <p>
    <script>
      let name;
      let age;
      let city;
      let country;
      let job;

      name = "Sam";
      age = 25;
      city = "New York";
      country = "USA";
      job = "Software Developer";

      document.write(`Hi, my name is ${name}. I am ${age} years old. I live in ${city}, ${country}. I work as a ${job}.`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <h2>Example 4</h2>
  <script>
     {
      let a;
      let b;
      let c;

      a = 12;
      b = 3;
      c = a + b;
      document.write(`${a} plus ${b} is equal to ${c}.`)
    }

  </script>
  <h2>Example 5</h2>
  <script>
    let callhistory;
    let calltime;
    let calltype;
    let callcost;

    callhistory = "incoming";
    calltime = "morning";
    calltype = "local";
    callcost = 1.25;

    document.write(`You have an ${callhistory} call in the ${calltime}. It was a ${calltype} call and it cost you ${callcost} dollars.`)
  </script>
  <h2>Example 6</h2>
<script>
  const str = 'Hello';
  const str2 = 'World';
  const str3 = '!';
  document.write(`${str} ${str2} ${str3}`);
</script>
<h2>Example 7</h2>
<p> look in Developer tools to find the code</p>
<script>
  console.log(`The sum of 2 and 3 is ${2 + 3}`);
  // expected output: "The sum of 2 and 3 is 5"
</script>
<h2>Example 8</h2>
<p> look in Developer tools to find the code</p>
<script>
  let message = `The time is ${new Date().getHours()}:${new Date().getMinutes()}`;
  console.log(message);
  // expected output: "The time is 15:30"
  console.log(`The time is ${new Date().getHours()}:${new Date().getMinutes()}`);
  // expected output: "The time is 15:30"
</script>
